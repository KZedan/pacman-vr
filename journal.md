Day 1 : 
-Decided on augmented reality children's book app running on unity with vuforia AR package
-Built simple augmented reality app of  3d polygon characters appearing when image is tracked by mobile phone camera
-Received feedback from Alice on project: worries that unity projects are hard to debug and that there might not be enough 
manual programming. She also felt our project didn't have a clear enough end-goal
Day 2 :
-beginning of day decide to pivot to VR pacman game
-split into two teams
-Kay , kareem and marvin maze team  created pacman maze environment in unity
-james and ian responsible for VR move-by-looking
-early afternoon , ian finds solution for VR move-by-looking
-kareem and jamie set up github with unity gitignore after many git conflicts and errors
-maze and move-by-looking merged
-attempted to deploy to android phone : built , ran and displayed well but did not move
-retro decided priorities
Day 3:
-beginning of day wrote down user stories on trello and decided priorities, ate marvin's late donuts
-kay had developed  golf balls that disappear on touch and trump enemy that chases player overnight
-main to-dos for the day : create UI to control game flow i.e. start game screen, work on trump ghosts/coins,
fix deployment bug from yesterday
-kareem and jamie on UI team worked out button selection/script activation from viewing for use in menus, found more stable
VR camera setup
-kay, marvin and ian on ghost team
-Kay progressed on ghost AI
-marvin and ian developed teleporter for the arena
-marvin started background music
-kay and jamie deployed to mobile, can move but introduced display bug
-kay , marvin, jamie and ian deployed marvin and ian's changes to mobile. was able to move but could walk through walls, 
big pauses, teleporters not present, performance deterioated with time. probably a result of head camera set up not working 
well
-kareem progressed towards start screen
-retro decided priorities for tomorrow : UI , points/lives/die on trump touch
-last hour had problems with git and merges, attempted to get Kay up to date eventually succeeded. recognised need to either 
alter workflow , e.g. after developing a feature, make sure to pull the latest master then add your changes before trying 
to pull request and merge your branch to tryand minimise time-costing merge conflict resolutions
-retro decided priorities for tomorrow
